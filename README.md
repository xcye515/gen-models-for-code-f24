Overview

This project compares CodeT5 (non-AST-based) and AST-T5 (AST-based) for code generation tasks, focusing on fine-tuning them with a custom Rust dataset. The study highlights how Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) enhance performance, particularly for less common programming languages.

Code for completing the following tasks can be found:

Dataset Preparation: preprocessing.py
Fine-tuning AST T5 and model evaluation: ast-t5.py
Fine-tuning T5 and model evaluation: t5.py
